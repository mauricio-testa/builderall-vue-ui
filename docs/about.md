# About docs

This library was built using some components of the [BootstrapVue](https://bootstrap-vue.org/) library.
Thus, using it you have at your disposal 3 types of components:

* **Bootstrap Vue native components** - All components, directives and helpers available natively through [BootstrapVue](https://bootstrap-vue.org/)
* **Builderall Vue UI Components** - Components developed by Builderall that meet the specific needs of the company (See [Components](/components/bui-navbar.html))
* **Bootstrap Vue components with custom CSS** - Native components of BootstrapVue but with customizations (See [Bootstrap components](/bootstrap/b-alert.html))

Builderall Vue UI's own components are prefixed by `bui-`<br>
Native BootstrapVue components are prefixed by `b-`<br>
